        Hey, my name is Rehman Mohammed. I'm a software engineer from Toronto, Ontario, currently studying Computer Engineering at McMaster University. Proficient in Python, Java, SQL, and JavaScript, I've built full-stack applications using frameworks like ReactJS and Node.js, developed robust backend systems, and created interactive data dashboards using industry tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Looker. I have experience constructing ETL pipelines using tools like Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, and Python libraries. Additionally, I'm skilled in using cloud platforms such as AWS and Google Cloud Platform to deploy and manage applications. Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy participating in marathons throughout Toronto to stay fit and connected with my community. Thank you for visiting my website. Feel free to explore my projects and experiences, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!
